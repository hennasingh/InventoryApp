# InventoryApp

Inventory App. This is 10th and final project in android scholarship program. The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. It will also need to allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

I have tried to capture almost all features of app, images used are only as references. A gif below
